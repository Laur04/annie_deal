        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal did not know a school was named for her.  The naming of the new junior high in her honor, posthumously, was led by the friends, colleagues, parents, and organizational leaders she interacted with during her lifetime in DC.  While there were plans for new junior highs to be built across the city while Miss Alice Deal was alive, she did not know one, already being budgeted and planned for, would bear her name.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DC Board of Education approved a five year school building program act, which was approved on February 26, 1925.[1]  The money from this five year act funded what would become Alice Deal Junior High.  The search for a suitable site for a new junior high started in 1926.[2]  Shortly after Miss Alice Deal’s death, in June 1928, an article ran in the Evening Star which said [who?] would rename a school for Miss Alice Deal.[3]  The land for a new junior high site, the Reno site, was purchased on September 30, 1928.[4]  This site would become what is today Alice Deal Middle School.  In November 1928, a group of community members and parents [provide names] met to promote the idea of this new junior high at the Reno site to be named in honor of Miss Alice Deal.[5]  In March of 1929, the American Association of University Women, of which Miss Alice Deal was a member, met to decide what role they would play in create a memorial for Alice Deal.[6]

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, “The initial appropriate of $200,000 for the Alice Deal Junior High School became available on July 1, 1929.”[7]  “In some instances, however, appropriations are made for buildings before the site is acquired, his statement continues.  …The site for the Alice Deal Junior High School has not been acquired to date…”[8]  “A verdict from the Condemnation Court, expected January 10, 1930, it is hoped, will speed action on the Alice Deal School.  Harris [the building contractor] explained that delay in beginning of construction of the Deal School will be avoided through recent action of Congress in authorizing that a certain sum of money from the unexpended balance of previous school appropriations be used without limitation to pay the condemnation jury’s price.”[9]  The completion of the expenses for Alice Deal Junior High was documented in 1931in the Budget with the US Government.  The submitted final completion cost was $300,000.[10] <em>---flesh this out and build transition sentences explaining this whole thing</em>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fall of 1931, Bertie Backus, as the principal of the new Alice Deal Junior High, opened the school’s doors for students.[11] On November 13, 1931 Alice Deal Junior High was formally dedicated in honor of Miss Alice Deal.[12]  The Evening Star reported, “High tribute was paid to the late Miss Alice Deal, Washington school teacher, who was a pioneer in the establishment here of the junior high school system, by Dr. Frank W. Ballou, superintendent of schools, at the formal dedication last night of the Alice Deal Junior High School in the Fort Reno section of Chevy Chase.”[13]  On June 11, 1932 The Evening Star headlined an article that read “Memorial Rites Held in School for Alice Deal:  Tribute is Paid to Pioneer in Junior High Work Here.  Portrait and Tablet Presentation is Made:  Service and Devotion in Advancing Public Education is Praised by Speakers.”[14]  The article presents a photo that is captioned, “A portrait of Alice Deal was presented last night to the junior high school bearing her name at memorial services.  In the photo, left to right:  Stephen E. Kramer, assistant superintendent of public schools;  Priscilla and Charlotte Patterson, nieces of Miss Deal, who unveiled the portrait, and Frank J. Sabotka, president of the Alice Deal Memorial Association.”[15]  Dr. Kramer said, “I hold..that we must believe that in some way the contribution of our lives to the service four fellow men becomes part of a great mystical force which continues in beauty and power beyond that narrow confine which we call life and becomes a very real part of the corporate existence in the communion of the spirit—so we pass on, remembered not only for what we have done, but for what we have been, and I can render no tribute to Alice Deal better than the hope that this building shall memorialize her for what she was and continues to be.”[16]

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of note was that in January 4, 1934 Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt visited Deal.[17]  And one of the first classes of Alice Deal Junior High, if not the first, graduated January 31, 1934 a class of 79 students in a mid year promotion ceremony.[18]  A classified ad on October 2, 1935 advertised for a home that was near “the new… Alice Deal Junior High School”.[19]
