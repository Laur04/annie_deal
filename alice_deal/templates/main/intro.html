    <strong>Rationale and Contribution to the Field</strong>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taught in DCPS for more than 20 years and nine of those at Alice Deal Middle School, yet until this project, I knew very little about who Miss Alice Deal was as an individual, leader, and pioneer in the city’s school system.  I hope this project shares about Miss Alice Deal’s life and legacy as an educator, leader, and voice for her fellow teachers, students, and children of DC. This is also the 90th anniversary of Alice Deal Junior High’s opening.  There is no formal history of Miss Alice Deal.  Miss Alice Deal is a leader in both the union and the DC leadership circles.   This research provides a written history of the life of Miss Alice Deal and also examines the national issues in a local way:  the Red Scare, the fight for increased teachers’ pay, and the implementation and growth of junior high schools.

    <strong>Approach</strong>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study is a qualitative approach which will use documentary editing.  The primary information, “data,” was collected through letters sent to Miss Alice Deal’s family upon her death, and letters sent to Miss Alice Deal later in her life.  Newspaper articles printed during her lifetime, or shortly after her passing, were used to better understand her actions and how the media viewed her.  In addition to research about Miss Alice Deal herself or the school named after her, books and online resources used were to further research the history of junior highs in the United States, the history of teacher unions in the 20th century, and broader historical events that are referenced in news articles or letters that influenced who Miss Alice Deal was and the world in which she lived.

    <strong>Scope and Methodology</strong>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project’s historical scope is from 1877 (when Miss Alice Deal was born) through 1940 (the end of the decade in which Alice Deal Junior High opened).  This section’s purpose is to give historical context to the time period that is discussed in this paper and this project. This research entailed a lot of letter reading.  The letters are from her college friends, community members, members of organizations she worked with, former students she taught, colleagues, the Superintendent of DC Public Schools, the parents of students, students from the school she was a principal of, and people whose connection to Miss Alice Deal is unclear, but the admiration for Miss Alice Deal was sincere. Newspapers in which she is featured, or the school that is named for her is featured in, were reviewed.  These newspapers have been incredibly helpful and important.  The frequency to which Miss Alice Deal is featured in the newspapers tells of her importance.  She was regularly featured in three DC newspapers.  While she is local, the fact that she received press in national papers (The Washington Herald, The Evening Star, and The Washington Post, and the Baltimore Sun) shows that she also had a national presence.  The Washington Herald, a daily newspaper in Washington, DC and founded in 1906, was in operation until 1939 with a peak circulation of 50,000.  The [Washington] Evening Star ran for 129 years from 1852-1981 in Washington, DC, had a conservative political reputation.  The Washington Post, a Washington, DC newspaper was founded in 1877 (the same year Miss Alice Deal was born!) and a year later had a circulation of 13,000.  The Baltimore Sun, out of Baltimore, MD was founded in 1837.  With the letters, there is documentation of Miss Alice Deal’s impact outside of Washington, DC. Ancestry.com was helpful learning about her family.  This was helpful for understanding her family tree and to view documents from the census that include Miss Alice Deal.  Her family history was important because her sister Miss. E. Grace Deal took care of Miss Alice Deal while she was sick.  Letters sent to Miss Alice Deal while she was sick were sent to her sister’s address.  Letters of condolence were sent to her sisters and brother, also living in DC.   Since the National Archives is closed due to the pandemic, and research at the National Archives isn’t possible, it was wonderful to find these census documents, with her name in it.  Exploring the Genealogy Bank didn’t prove to be useful—everything found there was already discovered in Ancestry. While not research, there was a visit to the grave site of Miss Alice Deal, and her sister, Miss E. Grace Deal, who took care of Miss Alice while she was sick.  Miss Alice Deal is buried with her mother and father, Miss E. Grade, and her sister Flora.   Other visits were to the Victoria Apartments in Washington, DC where Miss Alice Deal lived, the site where Columbia Junior High was located (no longer there), and where her brother lived and received many condolence letters.
