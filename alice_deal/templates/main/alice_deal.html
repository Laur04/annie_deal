        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Rosalba Deal was born on December 16, 1877 in Hampstead, Carroll County, Maryland to George S. Deal and Charlotte V. Wheeler.  In the 1900 census her father George S. Diehl  is listed as head of house, followed by Charlotte his wife (age 47), (married 27 years) daughter Flora (age 24), daughter Alice R. (age 22), son John A. (age 20), daughter E. Grace (age 18), [sister, but listed as son in census] Clay K. (age 16), son George P. (age 14), and son Oliver L (age 10).  According to this census, Miss Alice Deal was a teacher and living at home.  Her father was a farmer, older sister Flora was a dressmaker, and John A. was a fireman/R.R. The rest of her siblings were listed as “at school.” All household members were listed as being able to read and write and speak English.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal lived in Baltimore, MD in 1900 according to Ancestry.com and then moved to Washington, DC in 1908 when she took a job as teacher.  In the 1910 census, Miss Alice Deal is listed as a teacher in Washington, DC public schools, with a single marital status, and listed as the head of household.  Her mother passed away in 1908 and her father passed away at the age of 73 in 1914 in Maryland. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There isn’t much about Miss Alice Deal’s childhood.  She graduated from Reisterstown High School in June 1892 and participated in the fifteenth annual commencement exercises.  She has some music training because a newspaper blurb shared that she participated in a musical afternoon (a recital?) hosted by Mrs. N. Frank Cofiell whose class consisted of fourteen pupils, of which Miss Alice Deal was one.  In August of 1892 The Democratic Advocated announced that Miss Alice Deal was an applicant for scholarship to the State Normal School and passed. There is no other mention of this Normal School.  The next time she appeared in the newspaper she was a student at Goucher College.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal attended Goucher College in Baltimore, Maryland and graduated in 1899.  Goucher College was founded as a liberal arts and sciences education school.  Originally, the school was named the Woman’s College of Baltimore City and its campus was in initially in downtown Baltimore.  As a student at Goucher, she participated in field day events, was elected an officer, secretary, of the Woman’s College Chapter of the College Settlements Association, and participated in annual contents for women’s college athletes as a basketball player.  In her college years, Miss Alice Deal attended talks about men’s civic duty to enlist (and not sit in parlors!), attended Senior Tea, and ultimately graduated with a Bachelor of Arts on June 6, 1899.  Throughout her life, Miss Deal remained connected to Goucher College, by attending reunions and even helping to fundraise for her alma mater in 1926.  From her letters it is clear that she remained in touch with her college friends throughout her life.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unclear what Miss Alice Deal did for the year 1900.  It was reported in the Baltimore Sun in September 1901 that she was put on a ballot to be the Vice Principal of a school, however, another woman received more ballots than she did, so she did not get the job.  However, two days later the same newspaper reported that she had been appointed “teacher of the public school at Parkton.”  With a turn of events that is unclear, the Baltimore Sun reported ten days later, that she was appointed principal of School 13, District 7.  There is no other mention of her during the 1901-02 school year.  A teacher certificate was awarded to Miss Alice Deal in July 1902, which was announced with the release of State Examinations in local newspapers.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socially, Miss Alice Deal was busy as a young professional woman.  She attended informal dances, participated in religious camps, attended a Valentine Day party, and wrote in the Baltimore Sun, that she and a friend “have left the grove for a visit to Mountain Lake Park.”
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baltimore Sun, on June 18, 1903, reported that Miss Alice Deal was appointed Vice Principal of the Catonsville High School, a position she would hold until 1907.  During her years at Catonsville High School, Miss Alice Deal was reported in February 1904 to be confined “with a severe attack of illness” but was improving.  This is noteworthy because it was reported in the newspaper and it is as mysterious as the illness surrounding her death.  There has been no other mention of her being ill until March 1928, the month of her death.  As Vice Principal, Miss Alice Deal was elected chairman of the musical committee of the Irving Literary Society of Catonsville High School in October 1904.  She attended the first annual meeting of state teachers.  In July 1905 it was reported that Miss Alice Deal took a post graduate course at New York City’s Columbia University.  On December 12, 1907, the Baltimore Sun reported that Miss Alice Deal, was leaving as Vice Principal of the Catonsville school to “begin educational work in Chicago.” However, nothing further was found about the gap between December 1907 and her next professional endeavor in 1908.  A letter from Miss Alice Deal’s Aunt Mollie shared that Miss Alice Deal’s mother died in January 1908 and this perhaps changed the course of Miss Alice Deal’s life.  Aunt Mollie wrote Miss Alice Deal on January 2, 1908, “I feel so thankful that you had not started to Chicago.”  A letter from Miss Alice Deal’s Uncle, R.J. Wheeler dated January 4, 1908 confirms that Charlotte Wheeler Deal, Miss Alice Deal’s mother died and he asked Miss Alice Deal in the letter, “When will you go to Chicago?”  There is no further mention of Chicago in the letters.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her time as a Vice Principal at Catonsville High School, Miss Alice Deal maintained a full life outside of school.  In August of 1904 she went to the Fair (perhaps the World’s Fairs, which was held in Saint Louis that year?) and in the same article shared that she would have a stop with friends in Chicago.  She taught a Sunday School class and gave a paper reading in the afternoon (topic unknown) at the Union Sunday School Institute in 1906.  She was a member of the Chorale Society and sang as a Soprano at Catonsville High School in 1907 (unsure if this was related to her teaching position or independent).  In July  of 1907 she spent time with friends on the Severn River outside of Annapolis.  In September 1907  she attended the Blue Ridge Summit, a religious retreat.  While this paper focuses on Miss Alice Deal the teacher, the union leader, and the principal, these social updates in the newspaper help to inform what Miss Alice Deal participated in socially. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 11, 1908, Miss Alice Deal was appointed as a Mathematics teacher at McKinley Manual Training School in Washington, DC.  There were no public records of Miss Alice Deal’s career from 1908 to 1918.  Then, on May 30, 1918 The Washington Herald reported, “Miss Alice Deal, of the McKinley High School, was elected president of the High School Teachers’ Union of Washington at a recent meeting of that organization at Central High School.”  This position became available when her predecessor retired.  Miss Alice Deal spoke out previously as a representative of DC teachers at a Senate committee hearing on civil service in August of 1917, and recommended a contributary plan for pensions for all teachers.  On the same topic, Miss Alice Deal gave a report about the convention of the A.F. of L. in Buffalo in December in which she was chairman of the pension committee of the High School Teachers’ Union.  “The labor convention, according to Miss Deal, unanimously favored the pension bill for school teachers.”  This seemed to mark the beginning of her career as an advocate for teachers.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major issue that Miss Alice Deal tackled in her presidency of the High Teachers’ Union was about the delay in pay for teachers as reported on October 3, 1918.  Miss Alice Deal addressed the DC School Board of Education and asked why teachers had not been paid their September salary on time and why this was a yearly issue.  The Superintendent said the delay was caused due to a government increase that caused more clerical work.  Two days later a longer article with more information about the teachers delay in pay was printed in the Washington Herald.  According to the article, Miss Alice Deal stated that 2,200 Washington, DC teachers were overdue in their pay.  They hadn’t been paid since July and were financially broke.  Miss Alice Deal shared that many of the teachers wanted to buy at least one $100 war bond, however because of their lack of pay they couldn’t, thus the District would lose $220,000 in war bonds.  The resolution of the pay issue hasn’t been found, but this issue made local news and laid the foundation for Miss Alice Deal’s pay advocacy work that would continue, locally, and nationally, into 1919 and 1920.  The issue of teachers’ pay, particularly after World War I, was an important one to many returning veterans, and by being the High School Teacher’s Union representative she spoke for teachers and veterans. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“On October 2, 1918, she was granted leave of absence for war service, and returned to service in the McKinley High School on December 30, 1018 [sic].” After numerous searches on Ancesty.com, the National Archives, and other sites, it is unclear what Miss Alice Deal’s war service detail was.  However, during World War I, common jobs for women included being an American Red Cross worker, Salvation Army “Lassies”, librarian, “Hello Girls,” and nurses.  The National Park Service writes, “Five million men were mobilized for service in the Great War.  Over nine million women mobilized themselves.”  In some capacity, Miss Alice Deal was one of those nine million women, for three months of her life.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal is next mentioned in the media in the Washington Times on April 9, 1919 with the headline “Leader of Union Will Take Case Before the Courts.”  In this highly, nationally, publicized event, Miss Alice Deal spoke on behalf of Miss Alice Wood, as her union leader, and “1,000 District school teachers on the question of teachers rights, in the case of Miss Alice Wood, who was suspended without a hearing for her discussion of current events.”  Miss Alice Wood was suspended “because of Bolshevist tendencies” because she taught current events of the Red Scare in her classroom as a social studies teacher.  The probe went all the way to the DC Supreme Court. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal spoke out on behalf of Miss Alice Wood and against the Board of Education throughout the several month-long process.  Multiple times, Miss Alice Deal went on the record against Miss Alice Wood’s persecution for teaching about current events in the classroom.  Miss Alice Deal is quoted as saying, Miss Wood’s suspension and that the accusation that a “small but select group of Bolshevists were using the High School and Grade School Teachers’ Unions of Washington to cloak their activities” was “insidious and unjust propaganda.”  The article continues, “There are, to the knowledge of the teachers’ unions, no ‘reds,’ parlor Bolchevists,’[sic] so called philosophical anarchists’, or other radicals in teachers’ organizations of Washington,” said Miss Deal.”  She continues to say that any persons who were found to be so would be “dealt with by officials” and that any Bolshevik propaganda would not be tolerated by the union.  The Fear of the Red Scare permeated the country.  Washingtonians watched this national fear play out through the case of Miss Alice Wood.    “We are true Americans and believe in the American Government,” said Miss Alice Deal.  Miss Alice Deal then continued to defend Miss Alice Wood and said, “Miss Wood, however, never defended Bolshevism. She merely explained Bolshevism.  She is not a Bolshevist, but an American—whose ancestors have lived in the country for several generations, and who fought in the American revolution.  She is as a patriotic as any other American.”   The investigation concluded in November 1919 when the DC Supreme Court found that Miss Alice Wood was “issued a write of mandamus ordering the Board of Education to rescind its action suspending her because she discussed bolshevism in the classroom.”  In the release of the decision, Miss Alice Deal was quoted as saying, “I am delighted.”  The article continued that Miss Alice Wood’s record was to be expunged and her week’s pay from suspension to be issued.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of Miss Alice Deal’s success as a union leader is in a June 18, 1919 article in the Marion Star (Marion, Ohio) where it says that “Miss Deal has just been unanimously re-elected president of the High School Teachers’ Union and in the election an unwritten rule of the teachers union was suspended, inasmuch as it has always been tacitly agreed to elect a president of the union for but one term.”  Miss Alice Deal’s tenure was not only news worthy in Washington, DC but also in other states.  Miss Alice Deal’s actions, especially as a union leader, appeared in newspapers in Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois throughout her professional career.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that Miss Alice Deal advocated for teachers, as the Union leader, was around the issue of pay.  Miss Alice Deal was an advocate of higher pay for all teachers of all grades. In September 1919 it was reported that Miss Alice Deal went before the Board of Education to petition for the Board of Education to submit higher pay costs to Congress for all DC teachers of all grades.   She was a national leader on this issue, as evident that her work appeared in newspapers around the country and gained momentum.  That same month in a Pennsylvania newspaper, Miss Alice Deal reported that she predicted there would be a teacher shortage of at least 50,000 due to low pay and men returning from the War with too little pay.  The article further detailed that the war time provision that gave more money for teachers’ salaries had since ended and provided part of that financial shortfall.  In February 19, 1920, the Akron Evening Times reported that Miss Alice Deal has said that “more pay is the only  way to save the nation’s public school system.”  The Lima Gazette the same day editorialized their report by concluding their story with, “It is hoped that every teacher and every mother will give her [Miss Alice Deal] all the help she needs in working for her cause.”  In December 1920, Michigan’s Ironwood Daily Globe reported, “Miss Alice Deal…is leader in the campaign which will be made throughout the country for a general rise in pay for the teachers of all grades.”  A similar story ran in the Chicago Tribute in March of 1921.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1919 the Board of Education established the first junior high in Washington, DC, to be named the Columbia Junior High, located at 7th and O Streets, NW in the former Central High School building.  The Washington Herald reported on September 19, 1919 that Miss Alice Deal was promoted to principal of the new junior high.  On the same day, another DC paper, the Evening Star, reported that the there was a question facing the High School Teachers’ Union in Miss Alice Deal’s appointment as principal:  could she retain her position as the Union leader and be principal?  The article continued, “It was explained today that Miss Deal’s membership in the union is almost certain not to be affected, because she will not draw the pay of a principal, but will merely be detailed as head of the new school.”  The article ended with the only concern was whether or not Miss Alice Deal *SHOULD* continue as president of the union.  The article also stated that there was precedence that when the union leadership position was held prior to the school promotion the position in the union could be maintained. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia Junior High formally opened in 1919.  On October 6, 1920 Congress approved pay for a junior high principal and Miss Alice Deal was acknowledged in that position, having started the job without pay.  In an October 6, 1921 article, The Washington Post reported that the enrollment grew from 200 in 1919 to an enrollment of 624 in its third year, with a limit of 800.  The headline said, “New Idea is Popular.  Whole City Served by This One Institution—Called Relief for Overcrowded Schools.”  Columbia Junior High’s success yielded the growth of more junior highs in the city.  “That Washington does not have enough junior high schools to relieve the great stress on the senior high schools and upper grades of the elementary schools is the belief of officials of the District schools.  Two additional junior high school buildings were provided for in the emergency building program appropriation last spring.  The addition of junior high schools is seen as one big avenue of relief from the present congestion in the District schools.”  Later that same month an article in the Washington Post reported that Congress favored more junior highs, schools that were bridging elementary to high school.  In 1922, Miss Alice Deal traveled to Rochester, New York to learn junior high pedagogy.  She suggested that DC follow Rochester’s curriculum of making a science an elective and English, math, and history required, with electives to be determined.  Special attention was given to using the junior high schools to bridge curriculum from elementary school to the high school in a gradual manner.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a junior high principal Miss Alice Deal was an advocate for students and advocated for educating the whole child, as evidence by program implementations of sex education in junior highs and using guidance counselors to support students who didn’t find academic success in school.   This is a newer philosophy in education at this time.  She partnered with such organizations as the Washington branch of the American Association of University Women (AAUW) and the Social Hygiene Society (of which she was a board member).  The AAUW donated $200 to pay the salary of a psychiatrist to work with “problem” students in a consulting department.  She also gave a series of talks, as principal, to the WCTU:  on welfare and “Harm Through Use of Tobacco.”
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, among her accomplishments was the creation, funding, and implementation of a summer program for students, initially called “Vacation High School” because it took place during the summer vacation.  This summer program offered both credit recovery and an academic enrichment program for students. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For some time there has seemed to be a need for a high school during the long summer vacation for the benefit of the following classes of pupils, --those who have failed in a subject during the regular session and wish to make up this work before the fall term, those who wish to take advanced work in a subject, and those who wish to complete the high school course in less than four years.” 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal implemented her summer program in 1916 as a teacher at McKinley, fundraising to cover the costs in her new program and directing the program herself. The summer vacation program ran six weeks.  In 1921, more than “threescore teachers” were hired to teach the classes and Miss Alice Deal was appointed the principal of the summer high school for the fourth year in a row.  In the summer of 1922 the enrollment in the summer program was “expected to reach 1,300 and possibly more.”  After her death the Superintendent shared, “Miss Deal was identified with the establishment of the summer high school for which, when the school was in experimental stage, she raised the funds necessary from private sources. She was the first principal of the summer high school and held this position until she resigned in 1025 [sic]. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a lot can be inferred about Miss Alice Deal’s character from the news articles of the time, perhaps none share as much as the letters, documents, and words spoken about Miss Alice Deal upon her death.  The Superintendent of schools at the April 4, 1928 Board of Education meeting gave a statement sharing the impact of Miss Alice Deal’s life on the DC Public School system, and concluded with, “She was a woman of fine mind, splendid and forceful character and will long be remembered as one of the great figures in the history of the Washington Public schools.”  The letters are an outpouring from community members, colleagues, parents, and staff members. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice Deal was sick for several weeks prior to her death and was cared for by her sister Miss E. Grace Deal.  Condolence letters to Miss E. Grace Deal speak of E. Grace’s commitment to taking care of her sister during Miss Alice Deal’s illness.  No where in the letters or in the newspapers is there an account of what Miss Alice Deal died from.   Miss Alice Deal is buried at Saint Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran Church Cemetery, in Upperco, Maryland.  She is buried near her parents, sister Flora, and her sister E. Grace.
